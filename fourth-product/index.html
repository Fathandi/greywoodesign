                        <p>This project is part of PT Greywoods Design's Custom Furniture & Furnishing service for a renovated house in a modern minimalist style. The clients are a young couple who wanted a neat, efficient and aesthetic home without sacrificing the functionality of the space.</p>
                        <p>The solution focused on creating custom furniture that was fully adapted to the layout, lifestyle, and specific needs of the occupants.</p>
                        <p>This project not only improves the comfort and appearance of the house, but also adds functional value in every corner of the room with a harmonious and precise design touch.</p>

                        <p>The project involved several key products: an L-shape kitchen set with moisture-proof HPL multiplex material and soft-close system, a master bedroom built-in wardrobe with glass and wood sliding doors, an ash wood-patterned floating TV panel with hidden cable rack, and an ergonomic work desk with cable tray and USB port.</p>
                        <p>All units were built based on the actual size of the room with 2D digital blueprint mapping and 3D visualization to ensure precise design integration.</p>
                        <p>Finishes, colors and materials were chosen in line with the client's interior theme: minimalist, bright and clean. Each unit has gone through a design revision stage until the client is 100% satisfied before the production process.</p>
